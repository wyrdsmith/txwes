These new layouts do not utilize tables and they’re already mostly responsive. Some things to note however:
1)      I have not built in IE8 compatibility. The top level css (that which is used for 1000px+) should be compatible, but anything below that will not be compatible.
2)      Interactivity still needs to be inserted, such as the 320px/480px navigation menus, the mobile search button and I’ve noted in the css where jQuery should be used to modify style attributes.
3)      There are also one or two missing elements such as the mobile social media buttons that appear in the top right and the apply now and send me info buttons that should appear on the left column in tablet views.
4)      Lastly, the no-nav and index style layouts have yet to be coded up with responsive CSS.
